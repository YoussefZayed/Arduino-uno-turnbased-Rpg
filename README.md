# BattleBones
# Arduino-turnbased-Rpg

For my summative I decided to make a turn based rpg on the arduino lcd. I did this because I found a joystick and thought an rpg game would make great use of the Joystick. I made a story about a boy on a quest to destroy the evil skeleton king. I wrote the entire story from scratch as well as coding the rest of the game from scratch.  I only used the base song from Sean Kerr but then modified it to make it suitable for my game. The game is largely random in terms of combat but has a strategy in what moves you can do.
